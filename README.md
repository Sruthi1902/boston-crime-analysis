# Boston Crime Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes **73,000+ Boston crime records** to uncover meaningful trends and support data-driven public safety strategies. Using **R, SQL, and Tableau**, I cleaned inconsistent fields, standardized messy datasets, and built interactive dashboards to reveal **temporal and geographic crime patterns**. The work demonstrates my ability to handle sensitive public-sector data while translating findings into actionable insights for policymakers and community stakeholders.

---

### Objectives
- Improve **data integrity** by resolving missing values, inconsistent offense codes, and location errors  
- Identify **temporal trends**, such as when violent crimes occur most frequently  
- Map **geographic hotspots** and risk areas for targeted interventions  
- Provide **dashboards and visuals** that make technical data accessible to non-technical decision makers  
- Apply **statistical testing** to uncover significant patterns in crime data  

---

### Tools & Skills
- **R** → data cleaning, statistical testing, regression analysis, visualization  
- **SQL** → querying structured datasets, filtering, aggregating, and joins  
- **Tableau** → interactive dashboards for temporal and spatial analysis  
- **Excel** → validation checks and quick data profiling  
- **Data Handling** → managing large, messy, sensitive public-sector datasets responsibly  

---

### Key Insights
- Found that **violent crimes were more likely later in the day**, supported by regression analysis.  
- Identified **high-crime streets** by aggregating location data, creating a ranked list of 20 most dangerous streets.  
- Detected that **median offense rates varied across months**, revealing seasonal crime fluctuations.  
- Improved overall dataset **accuracy and usability**, ensuring consistency across 73,000+ records.

### Why This Project Matters
Beyond technical skills, this project highlights how **data analytics can shape better policy decisions**. By turning messy datasets into clear insights, it shows how I can help organizations — whether public, private, or nonprofit — use data to drive **equity, safety, and community impact**.
